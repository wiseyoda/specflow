# Requirements Checklist: Workflow Consolidation

**Phase**: 0072
**Created**: 2026-01-17

## Design Command Requirements

- [ ] FR-001: `/specflow.design` produces all artifacts in sequence (discovery → spec → plan → tasks → checklists)
- [ ] FR-002: Design asks clarification questions inline with context
- [ ] FR-003: Design generates both implementation AND verification checklists
- [ ] FR-004: `--spec` flag cascades: regenerates spec + plan + tasks + checklists
- [ ] FR-005: `--plan` flag cascades: regenerates plan + tasks + checklists
- [ ] FR-006: `--tasks` flag cascades: regenerates tasks + checklists
- [ ] FR-007: `--checklist` flag: regenerates only checklists
- [ ] FR-008: Design is resumable if interrupted
- [ ] FR-008a: Discovery always re-runs when design resumes

## Orchestrate Updates

- [ ] FR-009: Orchestrate uses 4-step workflow (design, analyze, implement, verify)
- [ ] FR-010: Step indices are 0=design, 1=analyze, 2=implement, 3=verify
- [ ] FR-011: Auto-migrate state from old 9-step to new 4-step workflow
- [ ] FR-012: Status display shows 4 steps

## Roadmap Backlog

- [ ] FR-013: `/specflow.roadmap backlog` subcommand added
- [ ] FR-014: Backlog subcommand supports `--auto` and `--dry-run`

## Deprecation

- [ ] FR-015: Deprecated commands show migration guidance
- [ ] FR-016: Stubs follow existing pattern (~30 lines)
- [ ] FR-017: Deprecate: specify, clarify, plan, tasks, checklist, backlog

## Documentation

- [ ] FR-018: CLAUDE.md updated with new workflow
- [ ] FR-019: docs/commands-analysis.md reflects consolidation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] SC-001: 11 → 6 active workflow commands
- [ ] SC-002: Design produces all 5 artifact types
- [ ] SC-003: Both checklist types generated by default
- [ ] SC-004: Deprecated commands have guidance
- [ ] SC-005: No breaking changes (migration path exists)
- [ ] SC-006: Step indices match new workflow (0-3)
