# Implementation Checklist: Orchestration Simplification

**Purpose**: Verify requirements quality and implementation readiness before coding begins
**Created**: 2026-01-23
**Feature**: [plan.md](../plan.md)
**Phase**: 1057

**Note**: This checklist is generated by `/flow.design` and verified during `/flow.implement`.

## Checklist ID Format

All items use `I-###` prefix (e.g., I-001, I-002).
Mark complete with: `specflow mark I-001`

---

## Requirements Completeness

Verify all necessary requirements are present in plan.md:

- [ ] I-001 Decision matrix conditions (G1.1-G1.18) are fully specified
- [ ] I-002 Batch state machine conditions (G2.1-G2.10) are fully specified
- [ ] I-003 Claude Helper use cases (G3.1-G3.17) are fully specified
- [ ] I-004 Question flow data plumbing (G4.1-G4.8) is documented
- [ ] I-005 Race mitigation patterns (G5.1-G5.13) are documented

## Requirements Clarity

Verify requirements are specific and unambiguous:

- [ ] I-010 Stale threshold is explicit: 10 minutes fixed (not configurable)
- [ ] I-011 Valid step values are explicit: design, analyze, implement, verify, merge
- [ ] I-012 Valid status values are explicit: not_started, pending, in_progress, complete, failed, blocked, skipped
- [ ] I-013 Atomic write pattern is specified: write to .tmp, then rename
- [ ] I-014 Claude Helper budget limits are specified: $1.0 for state recovery, $0.5 for stale diagnosis

## Scenario Coverage

Verify all conditions in decision matrix:

- [ ] I-020 Running workflow scenarios covered (G1.4-G1.7)
- [ ] I-021 Step complete scenarios covered (G1.8-G1.12)
- [ ] I-022 Error state scenarios covered (G1.13-G1.14)
- [ ] I-023 Spawn scenarios covered (G1.15-G1.17)
- [ ] I-024 Batch scenarios covered (G2.1-G2.10)

## Dependencies & Assumptions

Verify external dependencies are documented:

- [ ] I-030 Claude Helper API requirements documented
- [ ] I-031 File watching requirements (chokidar) documented
- [ ] I-032 State file format (OrchestrationStateSchema, OrchestrationExecutionSchema) documented
- [ ] I-033 SSE event types documented (session:question, session:created, session:activity)
- [ ] I-034 Project hash algorithm for CLI session detection documented

## Task Readiness

Verify tasks.md is implementation-ready:

- [ ] I-040 Every task has clear file path
- [ ] I-041 Task dependencies are explicit (phases ordered by dependency)
- [ ] I-042 Parallel opportunities marked with [P]
- [ ] I-043 Tasks are sized appropriately (single concern per task)
- [ ] I-044 Test tasks identified with test file locations

---

## Architecture Readiness

Verify pure function extraction is planned:

- [ ] I-050 `makeDecision()` is designed as pure function (no I/O)
- [ ] I-051 `handleImplementBatching()` is designed as pure function
- [ ] I-052 `validateState()` is designed as pure function
- [ ] I-053 `OrchestrationDeps` interface is designed for DI
- [ ] I-054 Clock abstraction is included in deps for time-based logic

## State Ownership

Verify state ownership pattern is clear:

- [ ] I-060 Orchestrate owns step transitions (step.current, step.index)
- [ ] I-061 Sub-commands only update step.status
- [ ] I-062 Two state files relationship is documented
- [ ] I-063 Cross-file invariants are specified

---

## Notes

- Address any unchecked items before starting implementation
- Items blocking implementation should be resolved by updating plan.md
- Use `specflow mark I-### --blocked "reason"` for items that cannot be resolved
