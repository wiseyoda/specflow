## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are creating or updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This command can operate in two modes:

1. **Discovery Mode**: If `.specify/discovery/` exists with artifacts from `/speckit.init`, use those to bootstrap the constitution
2. **Interactive Mode**: If no discovery artifacts exist, gather inputs interactively

## Pre-Execution: Check for Discovery Artifacts

**CRITICAL**: Before proceeding, check if discovery artifacts exist from `/speckit.init`:

```bash
# Check for discovery folder and key artifacts
DISCOVERY_DIR=".specify/discovery"
CONTEXT_FILE="$DISCOVERY_DIR/context.md"
DECISIONS_FILE="$DISCOVERY_DIR/decisions.md"
STATE_FILE="$DISCOVERY_DIR/state.md"
```

### If Discovery Artifacts Exist

1. **Load Discovery Context** from `.specify/discovery/context.md`:
   - Extract project name, type, criticality
   - Extract team context, timeline, constraints
   - Extract user/audience information

2. **Load Decisions** from `.specify/discovery/decisions.md`:
   - Parse all ADR-style decisions
   - Group decisions by phase and memory document impact
   - Extract principle candidates from key decisions

3. **Load Existing Memory Documents** from `.specify/memory/` (if exist):
   - Check for existing constitution.md (to update rather than create)
   - Check for tech-stack.md (generated by `/speckit.init export`)
   - Check for coding-standards.md (generated by `/speckit.init export`)
   - Check for other memory documents that inform constitution principles

4. **Synthesize Constitution from Discovery**:
   - Map decisions to constitution principles
   - Use project context to customize principle wording
   - Fill template placeholders from discovery data
   - Report what was auto-filled vs what needs user input

### If No Discovery Artifacts (Interactive Mode)

Proceed with the standard interactive workflow below.

---

## Standard Constitution Workflow

This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.

Follow this execution flow:

1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
     **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If discovery artifacts exist, use them as primary source
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it
   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded)
   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

3. Draft the updated constitution content:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):
   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any "Constitution Check" or rules align with updated principles.
   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.
   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).
   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.
   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.

5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):
   - Version change: old → new
   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

6. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).

8. Output a final summary to the user with:
   - New version and bump rationale.
   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.
   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).

## Discovery-to-Constitution Mapping

When discovery artifacts exist, use this mapping to derive constitution content:

### From context.md

| Context Field | Constitution Section |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Project Name | `[PROJECT_NAME]` |
| Project Type | Influences principle focus (app vs library vs service) |
| Criticality | Determines strictness level of principles |
| Team Size | Governance complexity |
| Timeline | Change velocity considerations |

### From decisions.md

| Decision Category | Constitution Impact |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Architecture decisions | Core architectural principles |
| Technology choices | Tech stack constraints in principles |
| Testing approach | Testing discipline principle |
| Security choices | Security principle |
| Performance targets | Performance principle |
| UX priorities | UX/Accessibility principles |
| Data handling | Data governance principle |

### Decision-to-Principle Template

For each relevant decision in `decisions.md`:

```markdown
## Principle [N]: [Derived from Decision Title]

**Status**: [MUST/SHOULD based on decision confidence]

[Principle statement derived from decision]

**Rationale**: [From decision rationale/context]

**Source**: Decision D-[X] from project initialization
```

## Memory Document Chain Reaction

After constitution is created/updated, check if other memory documents need creation or updates:

### If Memory Documents Already Exist (from `/speckit.init export`)

1. Check `.specify/memory/` for existing documents generated by `/speckit.init export`:
   - `tech-stack.md` → Validate against constitution, update if needed
   - `coding-standards.md` → Validate against constitution, update if needed
   - `api-standards.md` → Validate against constitution, update if needed
   - `security-checklist.md` → Validate against constitution, update if needed
   - `testing-strategy.md` → Validate against constitution, update if needed
   - `glossary.md` → Validate against constitution, update if needed

2. For each existing document:
   - Load and check for constitution compliance
   - Update if principles have changed
   - Ensure cross-references are valid

### If Memory Documents Missing (Interactive)

Offer to create additional memory documents:

```markdown
## Memory Documents to Create

The constitution references standards that should be documented. Would you like to create:

| Document | Purpose | Recommended |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| tech-stack.md | Approved technologies and versions | Yes |
| coding-standards.md | Code style and patterns | Yes |
| api-standards.md | API design patterns | If API project |
| security-checklist.md | Security requirements | Yes |
| testing-strategy.md | Test approach and coverage | Yes |
| glossary.md | Domain terminology | If complex domain |
```

## Formatting & Style Requirements

- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Do not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file or create from `.specify/templates/constitution-template.md` if no constitution exists yet.

---

## First-Time Project Setup

If this is a new project with no `.specify/` folder:

1. **Create folder structure**:
   ```
   .specify/
   ├── memory/
   ├── templates/
   ├── scripts/
   ├── discovery/
   └── archive/
   ```

2. **Copy templates** from user templates if available:
   ```bash
   # Check for user-level templates
   if [ -d "$HOME/.claude/speckit-system/templates" ]; then
     cp -r "$HOME/.claude/speckit-system/templates/"* .specify/templates/
   fi
   ```

3. **Create constitution template** if none exists:
   - Use `.specify/templates/constitution-template.md` if available
   - Otherwise create minimal template with standard sections

4. **Prompt user** to run `/speckit.init` first for full discovery, OR continue with minimal interactive constitution creation.

## Integration with /speckit.init

This command is designed to work seamlessly after `/speckit.init`:

**Recommended Flow**:
1. `/speckit.init` - Interactive project discovery (creates `.specify/discovery/`)
2. `/speckit.init export` - Generate memory documents (creates `.specify/memory/*.md`)
3. `/speckit.constitution` - Finalize and validate constitution (updates `.specify/memory/constitution.md`)

**Alternative Flow** (skip discovery):
1. `/speckit.constitution` - Interactive constitution creation
2. Manually create other memory documents as needed

The first flow is recommended for new projects as it ensures comprehensive requirements gathering before committing to architectural principles.
