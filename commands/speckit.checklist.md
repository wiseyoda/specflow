description: DEPRECATED - Use /speckit.design instead

## DEPRECATED

This command has been deprecated and consolidated into `/speckit.design`.

**Reason**: Checklist generation is now the final step of the unified design workflow, producing both implementation and verification checklists by default.

**Migration**:

```bash
# OLD (deprecated)
/speckit.checklist

# NEW (use this)
/speckit.design              # Full design flow including checklists
/speckit.design --checklist  # Regenerate only checklists
```

**What the CHECKLISTS phase in `/speckit.design` does**:
1. Loads spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md for context
2. Creates `checklists/` directory
3. Generates `implementation.md` - Implementation guidance checklist
4. Generates `verification.md` - Post-completion verification checklist

**Both checklists generated by default**:
- No separate invocations needed
- Consistent with spec/plan/tasks
- "Unit tests for requirements" approach preserved

**Checklist focus areas (preserved from original)**:
- Requirement Completeness
- Requirement Clarity
- Scenario Coverage
- Edge Case Coverage
- Acceptance Criteria Quality
- Non-Functional Requirements

**Cascade Behavior**:
- `--checklist` regenerates: checklists only
- Preserves: all other artifacts

For more information, run `/speckit.design` or see the documentation.
