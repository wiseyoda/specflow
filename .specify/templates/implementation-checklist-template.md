# Implementation Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]

**Purpose**: Verify requirements quality and implementation readiness before coding begins
**Created**: [DATE]
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md]
**Phase**: [PHASE_NUMBER]

**Note**: This checklist is generated by `/flow.design` and verified during `/flow.implement`.

## Checklist ID Format

All items use `I-###` prefix (e.g., I-001, I-002).
Mark complete with: `specflow mark I-001`

---

## Requirements Completeness

Verify all necessary requirements are present in spec.md:

- [ ] I-001 All user stories have acceptance scenarios defined
- [ ] I-002 Functional requirements (FR-###) cover all user stories
- [ ] I-003 Non-functional requirements (NFR-###) address performance, security, accessibility
- [ ] I-004 Success criteria (SC-###) are measurable and verifiable
- [ ] I-005 Edge cases and error scenarios are documented

## Requirements Clarity

Verify requirements are specific and unambiguous:

- [ ] I-010 No ambiguous terms (e.g., "fast", "user-friendly", "scalable") without metrics
- [ ] I-011 No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain in spec.md
- [ ] I-012 Technical constraints are explicitly stated
- [ ] I-013 Data formats and validation rules are specified
- [ ] I-014 API contracts define request/response schemas

## Scenario Coverage

Verify all user flows and edge cases are addressed:

- [ ] I-020 Happy path for each user story is complete
- [ ] I-021 Error handling scenarios defined
- [ ] I-022 Boundary conditions identified (empty states, max values, etc.)
- [ ] I-023 Authentication/authorization flows covered (if applicable)
- [ ] I-024 Concurrent/multi-user scenarios considered (if applicable)

## Dependencies & Assumptions

Verify external dependencies are documented:

- [ ] I-030 Required APIs/services identified in plan.md
- [ ] I-031 Third-party dependencies listed with versions in tech-stack.md
- [ ] I-032 Assumptions about data availability documented
- [ ] I-033 Integration points with existing code identified
- [ ] I-034 Required environment variables/configuration documented

## Task Readiness

Verify tasks.md is implementation-ready:

- [ ] I-040 Every task has a clear file path
- [ ] I-041 Task dependencies are explicit (blocking tasks identified)
- [ ] I-042 Parallel tasks marked with `[P]`
- [ ] I-043 Tasks are sized appropriately (not too large)
- [ ] I-044 Test file locations identified for TDD

## Notes

- Address any unchecked items before starting implementation
- Items blocking implementation should be resolved with `/flow.design --spec`
- Use `specflow mark I-### --blocked "reason"` for items that cannot be resolved
