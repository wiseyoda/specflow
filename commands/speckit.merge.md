## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Arguments:
- Empty or no args: Default behavior (auto-merge, delete branch)
- `--pr-only`: Create PR but don't merge (for review workflow)
- `--force`: Skip task completion check
- `--dry-run`: Show what would happen without executing
- `--next-phase`: After merge, automatically start the next phase

## Goal

Complete the current phase with a single command by:
1. Pushing the feature branch
2. Creating and merging a PR to main (or just creating PR with `--pr-only`)
3. Cleaning up the feature branch
4. Archiving orchestration state
5. Updating ROADMAP.md status to Complete
6. Displaying backlog summary

## Execution Steps

### 1. Pre-flight Checks

**1a. Parse arguments:**

```bash
# Check for flags
PR_ONLY=false
FORCE=false
DRY_RUN=false
NEXT_PHASE=false

# Parse $ARGUMENTS
```

**1b. Verify on feature branch:**

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" == "main" || "$CURRENT_BRANCH" == "master" ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Cannot merge from main branch"
  echo "Checkout a feature branch first: git checkout <branch>"
  exit 1
fi
```

**1c. Check for uncommitted changes:**

```bash
if ! git diff --quiet || ! git diff --staged --quiet; then
  echo "ERROR: Uncommitted changes detected"
  echo "Commit or stash changes first:"
  echo "  git add . && git commit -m 'message'"
  echo "  git stash"
  exit 1
fi
```

**1d. Verify task completion:**

```bash
# Get task status
TASK_STATUS=$(speckit tasks status --json 2>/dev/null)

if [[ -n "$TASK_STATUS" ]]; then
  INCOMPLETE=$(echo "$TASK_STATUS" | jq -r '.incomplete // 0')
  TOTAL=$(echo "$TASK_STATUS" | jq -r '.total // 0')

  if [[ "$INCOMPLETE" -gt 0 ]] && [[ "$FORCE" != "true" ]]; then
    echo "WARNING: $INCOMPLETE of $TOTAL tasks incomplete"
    echo ""
    speckit tasks incomplete
    echo ""
    echo "Options:"
    echo "  1. Complete remaining tasks before merge"
    echo "  2. Run with --force to merge anyway"

    # Ask user via AskUserQuestion
    # If they choose to abort, exit
    # If they choose to continue, proceed
  fi
fi
```

### 2. Git Push

**2a. Push current branch:**

```bash
echo "Pushing branch to origin..."
git push -u origin "$CURRENT_BRANCH"

if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Failed to push branch"
  echo "Check your network connection and try again"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 3. Create Pull Request

**3a. Check if gh CLI available:**

```bash
if ! command -v gh &> /dev/null; then
  echo "WARNING: GitHub CLI (gh) not installed"
  echo ""
  echo "Create PR manually:"
  echo "  https://github.com/$(git remote get-url origin | sed 's/.*github.com[:/]\(.*\)\.git/\1/')/compare/main...$CURRENT_BRANCH"
  echo ""
  echo "Then run: /speckit.merge --continue"

  # If --pr-only, exit here
  # Otherwise, wait for user to confirm PR is merged
fi
```

**3b. Create PR:**

```bash
# Get phase info from state
PHASE_NUMBER=$(speckit state get --json | jq -r '.orchestration.phase.number // ""')
PHASE_NAME=$(speckit state get --json | jq -r '.orchestration.phase.name // ""')

# Create PR
PR_URL=$(gh pr create \
  --title "Phase $PHASE_NUMBER: $PHASE_NAME" \
  --body "## Summary

Completes phase $PHASE_NUMBER ($PHASE_NAME).

## Changes

See spec and tasks in \`specs/$PHASE_NUMBER-$PHASE_NAME/\`

---
Generated by /speckit.merge" \
  --base main \
  2>&1)

if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  # Check if PR already exists
  EXISTING_PR=$(gh pr view --json url -q '.url' 2>/dev/null)
  if [[ -n "$EXISTING_PR" ]]; then
    echo "PR already exists: $EXISTING_PR"
    PR_URL="$EXISTING_PR"
  else
    echo "ERROR: Failed to create PR"
    echo "$PR_URL"
    exit 1
  fi
fi

echo "PR created: $PR_URL"
```

### 4. Merge Pull Request (if not --pr-only)

**4a. If `--pr-only` flag, stop here:**

```bash
if [[ "$PR_ONLY" == "true" ]]; then
  echo ""
  echo "PR created but NOT merged (--pr-only mode)"
  echo "Review at: $PR_URL"
  echo ""
  echo "After review, run /speckit.merge to complete"
  exit 0
fi
```

**4b. Merge PR:**

```bash
echo "Merging PR..."
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch

if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Failed to merge PR"
  echo "Check for:"
  echo "  - Merge conflicts (resolve manually)"
  echo "  - Required reviews (request reviews first)"
  echo "  - Failed CI checks (fix and push)"
  exit 1
fi
```

### 5. Branch Cleanup

**5a. Checkout main and pull:**

```bash
echo "Switching to main branch..."
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

**5b. Delete local feature branch (if it still exists):**

```bash
# gh pr merge --delete-branch handles remote, but local may remain
git branch -d "$CURRENT_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 6. Archive State

**6a. Run state archive:**

```bash
echo "Archiving phase state..."
speckit state archive
```

This moves the current phase to history and resets orchestration for the next phase.

**6b. Archive phase details to HISTORY.md:**

```bash
echo "Archiving phase details..."
speckit phase archive "$PHASE_NUMBER"
```

This moves the phase's detailed content (goal, scope, deliverables, verification gate) from ROADMAP.md to `.specify/history/HISTORY.md`, keeping ROADMAP.md lightweight.

### 7. Update ROADMAP

**7a. Mark phase complete:**

```bash
speckit roadmap update "$PHASE_NUMBER" complete
```

### 8. Display Backlog Summary

**8a. Show backlog items:**

```bash
echo ""
echo "============================================"
echo "Phase Complete! Backlog Summary:"
echo "============================================"
echo ""

speckit roadmap backlog list

echo ""
echo "Run /speckit.backlog to triage items into future phases"
```

### 9. Start Next Phase (if --next-phase)

**9a. If `--next-phase` flag is NOT set, show next steps and exit:**

```bash
if [[ "$NEXT_PHASE" != "true" ]]; then
  echo "Run /speckit.orchestrate to start the next phase"
  echo "Or run /speckit.merge --next-phase to merge and start next phase in one command"
  exit 0
fi
```

**9b. Get next pending phase:**

```bash
echo ""
echo "Starting next phase..."

NEXT=$(speckit roadmap next --json 2>/dev/null)

if [[ -z "$NEXT" || "$NEXT" == "null" ]]; then
  echo ""
  echo "No more pending phases in ROADMAP!"
  echo "All phases complete or add new phases with: speckit roadmap add"
  exit 0
fi

NEXT_NUMBER=$(echo "$NEXT" | jq -r '.number')
NEXT_NAME=$(echo "$NEXT" | jq -r '.name')
NEXT_BRANCH="${NEXT_NUMBER}-${NEXT_NAME}"
```

**9c. Create branch and initialize state:**

```bash
echo "Creating branch: $NEXT_BRANCH"
git checkout -b "$NEXT_BRANCH"
git push -u origin "$NEXT_BRANCH"

# Initialize state for new phase
speckit state init
speckit state set "orchestration.phase.number=$NEXT_NUMBER"
speckit state set "orchestration.phase.name=$NEXT_NAME"
speckit state set "orchestration.phase.branch=$NEXT_BRANCH"
speckit state set "orchestration.phase.status=in_progress"
speckit state set "orchestration.step.current=specify"
speckit state set "orchestration.step.index=0"
speckit state set "orchestration.step.status=in_progress"

# Update ROADMAP
speckit roadmap update "$NEXT_NUMBER" in_progress

echo ""
echo "============================================"
echo "Started Phase $NEXT_NUMBER: $NEXT_NAME"
echo "============================================"
echo ""
echo "Run /speckit.orchestrate to continue the workflow"
```

### 10. Dry Run Mode

If `--dry-run` is specified, display what would happen without executing:

```text
DRY RUN - Would execute:

1. Push branch: git push -u origin 0015-workflow-commands
2. Create PR: "Phase 0015: workflow-commands"
3. Merge PR: gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
4. Checkout main: git checkout main && git pull
5. Archive state: speckit state archive
6. Archive phase details: speckit phase archive 0015
7. Update ROADMAP: speckit roadmap update 0015 complete
8. (if --next-phase) Create branch for next phase
9. (if --next-phase) Initialize state for next phase

No changes made.
```
